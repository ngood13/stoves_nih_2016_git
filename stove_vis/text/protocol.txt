The data contained in this web visualization app was generated through laboratory-based emissions characterization tests that were performed at the Advanced Cookstoves Laboratory at the CSU Powerhouse Energy Campus. 

We conducted tests according to the Firepower Sweep Test protocol. In this protocol, stoves are systematically operated over a range of burn conditions, including both low temperature, slow fuel feed rates and high temperature, high feed rates. The goal of this approach is to provide a more robust representation of actual emissions during real in-home use (in which a cook may alternate between low-heat simmering and high-heat grilling or frying) than other laboratory testing procedures such as the standard water boil test, wherein a stove is operated at a consistent medium-level fuel burn rate and temperature. 

Emissions were collected within an encapsulating hood designed specifically for cookstoves emission monitoring. A constant volume of filtered air (4 m3/min) is drawn through the hood to achieve natural dilution and allow stove emissions to reach typical indoor concentrations. Emissions are then drawn through isokinetic sampling probes with PM2.5 cutpoint cyclones to filter cartridges, gas collection canisters, or real-time instruments (as appropriate for each specific pollutant). Various particle- and gas-phase compounds relevant to both health and climate are captured using a combination of real-time monitoring instruments and time-integrated filter-based sampling methods. Each combination of stove and fuel was tested in replicate (three tests per combination), in a semi-randomized order (availability of certain stoves/fuels and required adjustments to the sampling system to accommodate certain stove designs dictated some “blocking” of test types).
